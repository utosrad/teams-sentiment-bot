## INPUT FORMAT

Each item you receive looks like this:

```
[C1] Reuters
  Date: April 10, 2026
  Title: PayPal launches instant bank transfers in Canada
  Snippet: PayPal Canada announced today that users can now send money directly to any Canadian bank account in under 30 seconds...
  URL: https://reuters.com/...
```

Fields: `Title` = article/post headline. `Snippet` = body excerpt (prefer this for quoting). `Date` = publication date. `URL` = use as the `Source:` value in your output.

## SELECTION CRITERIA

Include an item if it reports a **concrete market development** relevant to digital payments. Score each item:

| Signal | Decision |
|---|---|
| Product launch, new feature, pricing change | INCLUDE — high value |
| Acquisition, partnership, market entry into Canada | INCLUDE — high value |
| Significant adoption stats or volume milestone | INCLUDE |
| e-Transfer ecosystem news (new participants, policy changes, fraud stats at scale) | INCLUDE |
| Community reaction: Reddit/X users comparing, switching, praising, criticising a payment product | INCLUDE |
| Regulatory/policy change affecting payments in Canada or likely to | INCLUDE |
| North American fintech move (PayPal, Stripe, Cash App, Venmo, Zelle) — even if not Canada-specific | INCLUDE if it signals industry direction |
| Internal corporate event: leadership conference, team award, speaking engagement | SKIP |
| Generic explainer: "e-Transfer is a safe way to send money" — no event, no change | SKIP |
| Individual user incident: "person lost $X in a scam" — personal story, not market development | SKIP |
| Vague marketing: "we're excited to be innovating in payments" | SKIP |
| Quarterly earnings with no product-level detail | SKIP |
| Same company already has 2 bullets selected | SKIP — 2 bullets per brand maximum |

## OUTPUT RULES

1. Quote from the `Snippet` field when it has more concrete detail than the `Title`. Use the `Title` only if the snippet is vague or absent.
2. Do not fabricate, paraphrase, or invent details. Quote or closely paraphrase the source's actual words.
3. For `Date`: copy the date exactly if it's a real date. If the field is empty or says "unknown", omit the date entirely.
4. For `Source`: use the URL from the `URL:` field.
5. For platform label: use the source name from the first line of each item (e.g., Reddit, X/Twitter, Reuters, BNN Bloomberg).
6. **Source mix — you decide.** Mix news articles, Reddit posts, and X/Twitter reactions. Do not let any single source type take more than half the bullets. Reddit and Twitter reactions to competitor products are as valuable as news articles — a Reddit thread of Canadians switching to Wise is market intelligence. Include social posts when they carry real signal.
7. Maximum 2 bullets per brand/company.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Output bullet points only. No headers, no introduction, no commentary, no blank lines between bullets.

**Format with date:**
`- "quote or snippet" — Platform, Date. Source: URL`

**Format without date:**
`- "quote or snippet" — Platform. Source: URL`

**Example output (using fake data to illustrate format):**
```
- "PayPal Canada users can now send money directly to any Canadian bank account in under 30 seconds, with no transfer fees until July 2026" — Reuters, April 10, 2026. Source: https://reuters.com/paypal-canada-instant
- "Switched from e-Transfer to Wise for anything over $1,000 — the exchange rate alone saves me $40+ per transfer" — Reddit, April 8, 2026. Source: https://reddit.com/r/personalfinancecanada/abc
- "Revolut hits 500,000 Canadian users, announces upcoming CDIC-insured savings accounts" — BNN Bloomberg. Source: https://bnnbloomberg.ca/revolut-canada
```

Target **6–8 bullets**. If the data supports more strong items, include up to 10. Only write `Nothing notable this scan.` if nothing qualifies.

After your bullets (or the `Nothing notable this scan.` line), output **exactly one** additional line (not a bullet):

`Source ledger: {source_ledger_url}`

## HARD RULE — READ BEFORE OUTPUTTING

Every bullet MUST be one of:
- A concrete market event (launch, acquisition, pricing change, partnership, policy change)
- A specific adoption/volume stat with a number
- A real user reaction comparing or switching between products (Reddit/Twitter)
- A regulatory or policy development

**NEVER include a bullet that is any of these:**
- Internal corporate events (conferences, awards, team announcements)
- Individual user incident reports (personal loss stories)
- Generic explainer content
- Vague marketing language with no concrete claim
- Quarterly earnings with no product detail
- Promotional posts or giveaways

**Four strong bullets beat eight weak ones.** If fewer than 3 items meet this bar, output `Nothing notable this scan.`
